# Project0
In this project, I have built a simple website with four conneected pages. The website is a presumed blog that is built to disseminate information of national relevance in Nigeria. I have used three main three main presidential candidates as the main talking points sigthing some third-party statistics about their campaigns.

The website has four pages: the Home page(Home.html), the Projections page (Projections.html), the Contact Us page (Contact-us.html), and the About Us page (About-us.html).

On the project folder, you will find the four html pages listed above, the pictures used for the website development, the README file, the css file, and the scss file.
